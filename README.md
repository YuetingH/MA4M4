## Essay
Programming in my essay.
- **data**: Dataset of Political Blog obtained from https://www.cc.gatech.edu/dimacs10/archive/clustering.shtml.
  
    It is a single-day snapshot of over 1000 selected political blogs on February 8, 2005, which are manually labelled as either liberal or conservative. Only blog references and blog-roll links from the front page of each blog are counted as directed links.
    
    After prepossessing, we deal with a static directed unweighted network with neither self-loop nor multiple edges. It involves 1490 nodes and 33429 directed edges overall. Notice that the first 758 blogs are classified as left-leaning(liberal) and the remaining 732 are classified as right-leaning(conservative).
